# Summer Internship 2025: USRP Experiments

### Overview

This internship involved practical experimentation with USRP (Universal Software Radio Peripheral) devices, focusing on wireless signal transmission, reception, and propagation in various configurations with obstacles.

---

### Timeline & Activities

**Until 28 May**

* Learned the basics of USRP operation.
* Familiarized with the hardware and software setup.

**28 May**

* Conducted simple transmission and reception tests using two USRPs.
* The receiver (Rx) was placed in the line of sight of the transmitter (Tx).
* An obstacle (a bottle) was placed between the Tx and Rx to observe its effect.

**30 May**

* Moved the receiver to 30 degrees off the direct line of the transmitter antenna.
* The obstacle (bottle) remained on the direct line joining Tx and Rx.

**2 June**

* Arranged three receivers in an equilateral triangle configuration with sides of 120 cm.
* Positioned the Rx at the center of the triangle.
* Conducted measurements with the obstacle placed on one side of the triangle.

**3 June**

* Took readings with the obstacle placed on the other two sides of the triangle.
* Verified the power vs. distance plots for all three sides and all three receivers.

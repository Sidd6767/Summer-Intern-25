# Summer-Intern-25
Until 28 May- Basic stuff and figuring out USRP.

28 May- Simple Transmission and Reception using two USRPs. The Rx is in the line of sight of the Tx and the obstacle(bottle) is also kept in between the two.

30 May- The Rx is kept at 30 degrees from the receiver antenna. The obstacle(bottle) is kept on the line joining the two.

31 May-

2 June- Made a equilateral triangle of receivers of side 120cm with Rx at center. Took readings with bottle on one side of the triangle.

3 June- Took the readings on the other two sides of the triangle and verified the power v/s distance plots for all three sides of all three receivers.
